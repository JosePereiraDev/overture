This plugin is an experimental version of a code generator that generates
Java code from a subset of VDM++.

The plugin will indicate if a construct cannot be generated by highlighting
it in the editor using a marker (similar to the way warnings are shown)
as well as inform the user about it in the console. Generated code is
output in the generated/java folder.

Code generation runtime:

The generated Java code depends on a runtime/library to represent VDM
collections, VDM types etc. The source code for the runtime can be found
in the Overture Github repository:

<overture repository>\core\codegen-runtime

Try to code generate your own VDM++ models:

The VDM++ to Java code generator can be tried on some of the VDM++ models
bundled with Overture - simply import them from the Overture examples.
The code generator is confirmed to work with the AlarmPP and 
CashDispenserPP models.
